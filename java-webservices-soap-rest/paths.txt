web services
	1. machine to machine(application to application) interaction. (any application uses it).
	2. interoperable - not platform dependent. (eg. service built on any java used by service built on php)
	3. communication done over a network.
	
	
works on request -> response model.
to make it interoperable -> request respone should be platform independent. (eg. xml, json)

service definition -> request structure ? response structure  ? endpoint ? 

how is the service communication/transport done ? -> http or MQ(queue).



SOAP - restrictions on xml, exchanged between service provider & service consumer.
REST - architecture.
