the maven project at first has only a source folder and pom.xml file. 

If you are working with a spring boot project, you may see a mvnw (linux & mac) & mvnw.cmd (windows) file. These files are maven wrapper files. 
So that the user does not need to have maven installed.

 mvn validate: - looks at pom.xml - and performs checks (unknown). 
 
 mvn clean - 	deletes the target folder.
 mvn compile -  creates the target folder with necessary files from source.
 mvn compile test - compiles src files and looks at the test folders, runs the test inside them. 
 mvn package - (clean, compile & test & package the whole thing that you can send).
 mvn install - does all the things that mvn package does + puts the file in your local maven repository.
 
 
 For a multi-module maven project, the main pom.xml has <modules> defined for all it's child modules. 
 the dependencies defined here are common for all modules. 
 A module can refer to another module as a dependency with a version same as the project's version.
